    If you’ve ever wondered what happens when a curious kid with too many questions grows up — well, here I am, still asking better questions, but now with datasets, algorithms, and a healthy obsession with reproducibility.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I’m currently a <strong>Research Scholar at IISc's Computational Data Sciences department</strong>, walking the line between applied machine learning and foundational curiosity. My current work is centered on secure and efficient multi-modal federated learning — think LiDAR, radar, and images teaming up while protecting privacy.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    My path to this point? Winding and wonderful. I started off as an engineer, interned with HAL,BSNL, flirted with corporate software testing (hi Infosys 👋), and eventually found myself pulled deep into the world of research. I’m fascinated by problems that have no obvious answers — from <strong>cryptanalysis of ML models</strong> to building <strong>virtual terrains from sensor data</strong> in real time.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I thrive where there’s a puzzle to solve, a paper to question, or a dataset that doesn't want to behave. And if you hand me a whiteboard, I’ll probably draw more arrows than necessary. It’s a talent.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Beyond the research grind, you’ll find me dancing (literally — I'm also a Kathak dancer), journaling in 3 different notebooks at once, and making way too many to-do lists for someone who just wants to “go with the flow.”
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 italic text-blue-600">
    TL;DR — I believe the best science is the kind that gets shared, questioned, danced around (why not!), and ultimately builds something meaningful for everyone.
