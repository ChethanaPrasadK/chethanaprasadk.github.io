      They say dance speaks where words fail — and that’s exactly how I feel about Kathak.
      What started as a rhythmic curiosity two and a half years ago has grown into something far deeper —
      a silent language, a sacred ritual, a powerful storytelling form that flows through my breath and bones.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-justify">
      I’m currently under the soulful guidance of <strong>Guru Sharath R. Prabhath</strong>, whose clarity and grace
      continue to mold me. It’s a blessing to be part of a legacy shaped by <strong>Paramaguru Rajendra Gangani</strong> and
      <strong>Nirupama Rajendra</strong> — visionaries who brought fire, form, and finesse to the stage.

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-justify">
      I find beauty in the dialogue between the <strong>Lucknow</strong> and <strong>Jaipur gharanas</strong> — softness meets structure,
      abhinaya meets energy. It’s in this duality that my own style emerges. Whether I’m exploring rhythm or rasa,
      the form feels infinite.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6 text-justify">
      I recently earned a <strong>distinction in ABGMV (Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya)</strong> — a small milestone in this long,
      lifelong journey. Kathak has taught me discipline, humility, joy, and most of all, silence between movement.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl italic text-pink-700 text-center">
      Kathak is not just performance. It's prayer. A rebellion. A memory. A mirror. <br/>
      It's how I speak when words are not enough.
