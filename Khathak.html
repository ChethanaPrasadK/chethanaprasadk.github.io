      Long before I became an ML researcher, I was a dancer at heart and now it is a part of my life since 3 yrs. Kathak gives rhythm to my logic, grace to my thinking, and balance to the fast pace of research life.
      It’s how I breathe between equations.

     Kathak has been an intrinsic part of my identity, growing alongside my academic pursuits and shaping my discipline, expression, and understanding of tradition. My journey began over a decade ago, nurtured by an early fascination with rhythm, movement, and storytelling. What started as an after-school passion has now evolved into a serious, lifelong engagement with one of India’s most sophisticated classical art forms. I have been privileged to train under Sri. Sharath R Prabhath, whose lineage and teaching reflect a deep-rooted understanding of both the Lucknow and Jaipur gharanas of Kathak. Under his guidance, I have imbibed the lyrical grace, abhinaya (expression), and emotive subtlety of Lucknow style, as well as the powerful, percussive footwork and intricate rhythmic compositions that characterize the Jaipur tradition.

My training has involved years of rigorous practice, not just in executing technique, but in understanding the aesthetics, history, and spiritual underpinnings of Kathak. Whether it is exploring a thaat, mastertihai, theabhinaya piece set to trade

For me, Kathak is more than an art form—it is a method of inquiry, a form of cognitive grounding, and a continuous act of becoming. It has instilled in me an ethic of perseverance, attention to detail, and reverence for knowledge systems—qualities that extend into every aspect of my professional life as a scientist and researcher.
