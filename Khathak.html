      Long before I became an ML researcher, I was a dancer at heart and now it is a part of my life since 2.5 yrs. Kathak gives rhythm to my logic, grace to my thinking, and balance to the fast pace of research life.
      It’s how I breathe between equations.

      Trained in the classical Jaipur Gharana and Luckhnowi Gharana under the guidence of dasacharya sri Sharath R Prabhath. The discipline of dance informs the discipline of thought — and for me, one always feeds the other.
