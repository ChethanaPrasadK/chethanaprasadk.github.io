    They say dance speaks where words fail — and that’s exactly how I feel about Kathak.
    What started as a rhythmic curiosity two and a half years ago has turned into an inseparable part of my identity.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I’m currently training under the graceful guidance of <strong>Guru Sharath R. Prabhath</strong>, whose energy and clarity are a constant source of inspiration.
    I’m humbled to belong to a rich lineage of maestros including <strong>Paramaguru Rajendra Gangani</strong> and <strong>Nirupama Rajendra</strong> —
    legends who’ve shaped modern Kathak with elegance and fire.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    My style is a blend of both <strong>Lucknow</strong> and <strong>Jaipur gharanas</strong> — the subtle expressiveness of Lucknow paired with
    the dynamic footwork and power of Jaipur. I love exploring this balance with every composition I perform or create.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I recently took the <strong>ABGMV (Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya)</strong> examination and secured a distinction — a proud little milestone on this endless path of practice and discovery. 🙏
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 italic text-pink-600">
    Kathak is not just performance. It's storytelling, tradition, sweat, breath, and a quiet rebellion — all expressed in a spin and a smile.
