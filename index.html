        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Here’s the updated version of your "About Me": Hello! I'm Chethana Prasad Kabgere, a passionate Cloud ML Engineer with a focus on Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I completed my M.Tech(Research) in ML Engineering at PES University while simultaneously pursuing an MSCS at Georgia Tech with majors in ML and a minor in HCI. Currently, I'm a Research Student at IISc CDS, where I'm diving deeper into cutting-edge research.With experience in Cloud Engineering and Microservices, I have worked on building scalable cloud architectures and designing microservices from scratch. My goal is to explore how cloud technologies can integrate seamlessly with machine learning to create efficient, intelligent systems that improve user experiences.Outside of my technical work, I’m also a Kathak dancer, which helps me stay balanced and inspires creativity in my research and design work. I believe that art and technology can come together to produce innovative, user-centered solutions.Feel free to explore my work, and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss future opportunities!.</p>
