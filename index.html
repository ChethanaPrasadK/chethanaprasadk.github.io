        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! I'm Chethana Prasad Kabgere, a passionate Cloud ML Engineer with a focus on Machine Learning (ML), Microservices, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).After earning my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication, I started my career as an SDE at Infosys, Bangalore. I later transitioned into research, working as a researcher at PES University and IISc, Bangalore. As a result, I completed my MS (Research) in ML Engineering at PES University while simultaneously pursuing an MSCS at Georgia Tech, specializing in ML and HCI.experience in Cloud Engineering and Microservices, I have worked on building scalable cloud architectures and designing microservices from scratch. My goal is to explore how cloud technologies can integrate seamlessly with machine learning to create efficient, intelligent systems that enhance user experiences.Outside of my technical work, I’m also a Kathak dancer, which helps me stay balanced and fuels my creativity in research and design. I believe that art and technology can intersect to produce innovative, user-centered solutions.Feel free to explore my work, and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss future opportunities!.</p>
