        Hey there! Iâ€™m Chethana â€” a machine learning researcher, a privacy enthusiast, and someone whoâ€™s always up for digging into hard problems with clean, clever solutions.

Right now, Iâ€™m a Research Scholar at IISc CDS, immersed in a world where machine learning meets security. My work focuses on building privacy-preserving AI systems â€” not the heavy, slow kind with Homomorphic Encryption, but sleek, efficient alternatives that actually work in the real world. Iâ€™m also knee-deep in federated learning, cryptanalysis, and multi-modal sensor data fusion â€” yes, I love when multiple streams of data talk to each other to make smarter systems!

But letâ€™s rewind a bit.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Tech, where Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in scalable AI systems and privacy-aware computation. Before this, I completed an M.Tech (Research) in Machine Learning Engineering through PES University in collaboration with IISc, which offered me an incredible platform to dive deep into real-world research problems. Earlier, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication from VTU, Belgaum â€” the place where my fascination with the math and magic of technology truly began.

Before getting into full-time research, I worked at Infosys, where I handled functional testing in core banking systems, mainly Finacle. It was a crash course in how enterprise systems really work and how important robustness is. I also interned as a Research Engineer at HAL and BSNL, exploring practical engineering challenges in avionics and telecom.

Over time, my interests have naturally aligned toward making machine learning not just powerful but also responsible. That means secure, private, and ethical â€” all while being computationally efficient. No bloated models here!

Iâ€™ve always believed that research shouldnâ€™t be locked away in labs or PDFs. It should be usable. Scalable. Deployable. My current projects revolve around just that â€” making machine learning systems smart and secure enough to survive in the wild.

So, whether Iâ€™m building federated frameworks for sensor-based terrain detection, analyzing encryption systems, or dreaming up the next efficient privacy layer, Iâ€™m here to contribute to tech thatâ€™s thoughtful, ethical, and future-ready.

Thanks for stopping by and reading a little bit about my world! ðŸ˜Š
Letâ€™s build something meaningful.des functional testing at Infosys, research internships at HAL and BSNL, and now, cutting-edge research in AI privacy and security. Iâ€™m also a future graduate of <strong>Georgia Tech (Class of 2025)</strong>.
